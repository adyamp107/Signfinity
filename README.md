Signfinity is an application that can help deaf and mute people with disabilities to communicate with other people. In addition, Signfinity provides a dataset collection tool that allows users to create various languages ​​without limitations.

Signfinity provides various algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Convolutional Neural Network, and training models from Azure Machine Learning (coming soon).

We recommend using python 3.8.10 and pip 24.0 to be able to download all the appropriate dependencies.

python --version

python 3.8.10

pip --version
